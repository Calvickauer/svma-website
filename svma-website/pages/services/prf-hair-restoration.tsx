        <h2>What is PRF Hair Restoration?</h2>
        <p>
          Hair loss affects at least <strong>40% of men and women</strong> by the age of 35, which can be frustrating.
          While topical treatments can be irritating and oral medications come with side effects, <strong>PRF hair restoration</strong> 
          offers an effective solution with minimal risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          PRF contains <strong>growth factors and proteins</strong> that stimulate and nourish hair follicles, encouraging dormant 
          follicles to enter the growth phase and leading to thicker, stronger hair.
        </p>

        <h2>The PRF Treatment Process</h2>
        <p>
          After a consultation, the procedure takes approximately <strong>30 minutes</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A small blood sample is drawn and spun down to separate the PRF.</li>
          <li>No additives are usedâ€”just pure PRF.</li>
          <li>The PRF is carefully injected into the scalp at the follicle level using a very fine needle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After just a few sessions, you will notice <strong>thicker, stronger hair with reduced shedding</strong>.
        </p>

      <section className={styles.contentSection}>
        <h2>How Many Treatments Do I Need?</h2>
        <p>
          Patients typically need <strong>four sessions</strong>, scheduled <strong>2-4 weeks apart</strong>. 
          After completing the initial series, <strong>maintenance sessions</strong> every six months are recommended 
          to ensure continued hair growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          To maximize hair regrowth, we also recommend using a <strong>topical minoxidil product</strong>, available over the counter.
